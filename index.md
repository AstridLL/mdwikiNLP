**Cognitive Science Msc | Semester 1 | Fall 2020** 

The course addresses how we can approach theoretical and applied topics in human cognition using computational linguistics and natural language processing tools. The course also addresses key ethical topics that arise from the analysis of freely available natural language data, and in the development of natural language processing software and technologies. 

This course builds on studentsâ€™ background knowledge in statistics and statistical programming, and introduces students to working with large data sets. The course builds towards the data science course. The course introduces students to ethical and philosophical topics, which will be extended on in the data science course. The course prepares students for careers involving analysis of text and other forms of natural language data, and for careers involving development of natural language software.

Expectations / Workload
---------------------

Note: The nature of this course is that you have to be diligent about putting aside a little time to work (almost) every day. 

### Workload ###
Here's how much time you should roughly expect to spend on course activities each week. 

+ Video lectures = 2.5 hours 
+ Reading/study questions = 2-3 hours 
+ Group exercises = 2-3 hours
+ Coding assignment or final project work = 2-3 hours 
+ Wednesday classroom = 2 hours
+ Friday live lecture = 2 hours 


### Weekly work plan ### 

In each row of the schedule, you'll see what you need to do to keep up with the course that week. 

1. **Watch/Read** - Watch the video lectures and do weekly readings
2. **Exercises** - Do exercises with your study group to deepen your understanding of the content 
3. **Classroom** - Attend the classroom session for hands-on training in Python progrmaming  
4. **Assignments** - Occassional assignments to prepare you for the final exam

Troubleshooting and email policy
---------------------

![](googlingstuff.jpg)

This meme is funny because it's true. Programming can only be learned by doing. And no matter how much experience you have, it's a process of trial, error, and **lots and lots of Googling.** 

You're working on a group programming project and you're stuck. What do you do? 

1. Google it. 
2. Google it again. Try creative rephrasing. There is a very high chance someone has asked some version of your exac question on [StackExchange](www.stackexchange.org).
3. Try backtracking and simplifying your code. 
4. Use Google to find an alternative way of accomplishing the same task. 

Still stuck? 

5. Ask your classmates on Slack. 
6. Bring it to classroom sessions to troubleshoot. 


Assessment and exam
--------------

### Assignments 

You will have a number of group programming assignments to complete.

Use Github classroom to upload your assignments. You will receive an email invitation to register in week 36. 

### Assessment/Academic goals 
In the evaluation of the student's performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:

**Knowledge**: 
- contrast different natural language processing methods in terms of their strengths and weaknesses in different use contexts 
- explain how formal analysis of natural language can provide insights into human cognition and behavior 
- discuss ethical and philosophical issues related to natural language processing software and technology .

**Skills**: 
- identify relevant data sources for specific research and applied questions 
- correctly choose and apply tools for analyzing natural language data.

**Competencies**: 
- critically reflect on and discuss theoretical and empirical implications of using natural language processing techniques 
- justify the choice between relevant methods and analyzes used for specific research questions within the field of natural language processing 
- clear oral presentation of complex analyzes.

### Preparing project for your final exam

Start thinking about your final project idea as early as possible. If you would like to do a group assignment (*highly recommended*) you will have the opportunity to present a brief **project pitch** in week 43 (October 23) where you can recruit collaborators, or join someone else's cool project! 

### Final exam details  
Note: Oral exams will take place between January 25-28, 2021. 

The exam is an individual oral exam based on a written synopsis. The duration is 30 minutes including the student's presentation of the synopsis project, followed by dialogue with the examiners and assessment. 

The synopsis can be done as an individual or group assignment. If it is done as a group assignment, the final product must 

(i) form a coherent text and 
(ii) be organized so that it is possible to make individual assessments of the students contributing. 

In other words, the contribution of each individual student to the whole assignment must be clearly delineated (excluding the introduction, conclusion and bibliography). 

A maximum of three students can take part in a group assignment.
- Length of individual synopsis: 4-7 standard pages (not including code and figures) 
- Length of synopsis for 2 students: 8-14 standard pages (not including code and figures) 
- Length of synopsis for 3 students: 12-21 standard pages (not including code and figures)
