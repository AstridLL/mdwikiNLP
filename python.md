Basic Python quiz
---------------------
 
**Write code in Python which accomplishes each of the following tasks. Complete individually, and submit to Rebekah in a Slack DM.** 
If you've never coded in Python before, you'll have to do some self-paced learning first. I recommend using [LearnPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) and completing everything up to and including the Dictionaries module. 

### Tasks

**Task 1: Adding machine**

Write a function that adds two numbers x,y and returns the output x + y. Sample input might be x=-1, y=8 in which case the expected output is 7. The expected output is either float or int.

**Task 2: Character count**

Write a function that takes two arguments
- *s* an arbitrary string.
- *l* a letter (i.e. any valid single character).

The function should search the string for occurences of the letter and return an integer indicating how many times the letter *l* occurs in the string *s*.

Note: Your function should be case-insensitive, i.e. it shouldn't care if the letter is "H" or "h"

**Task 3: Function *isEven***

Write a function which evaluates if a given integer number (given as a parameter for the function) is an even number. The function should return a Boolean value True if the number is even and False if the number is odd.
Given a list (or array) of *n* integer numbers, write a program which uses the function *isEven* to determines the number of even items in the list.

**Task 4: Search in List**

Given a list (or array) of *n* floating-point numbers, write a program which searches and outputs the largest number in the list.

**Task 5: String and Loops**

Write a function which takes a string (word) as an argument. The function should print the complete word on the first line and remove the last character on each successive line, ending with a single (the first) character. 
Example: Input word is Test
Function output:
Test
Tes
Te


**Task 6: Get dict keys** 

Write a function that takes as it's single input any dictionary
The function should return the keys of the input dictionary, in a list.
