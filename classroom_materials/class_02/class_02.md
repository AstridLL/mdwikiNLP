# Class 2: Basic Packages and Modules
The plan for the class is still a work in progress.


### TL:DR
 - Download the Danish model for Stanza prior to class

## Download the Danish Model for Stanza
Before class you should have downloaded the Danish and English model for Stanford's NLP library Stanza. If you don't have stanza installed see [class 1](classroom_materials/class_01/class_01.md).

For a guide on downloading stanza models follow these step for a bit more control (or if you have any issues) see their online [guide](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/download_models.html):
- Open your python editor of choice
- Run the following:

```Python
import stanza
stanza.download('en')
stanza.download('da')
```
